### An Overview
This is a continual work in progress, please be advised that things may and will change.

This project is an attempt to enable multiple game modes under a single framework, to enable more people to easily create their own, custom FiveM servers.

Currently the project is unstable, as I work out the best way to enable the multiple game mode options and deal with the quirks that come with it.

#### Test Server

We Currently have our test server running the most recent release made here on the github.

It is currently showing out the multi-character for the Role Play style game mode for FiveM.

You can join it, by joining our **[discord](https://discord.gg/988ERxVF2t)** and hitting the :video_game: 
emoji on the #welcome page.

You can find it from a simple search within the **[server browser](https://servers.fivem.net/)**: ***ingenium.games***

The other resources used on the test server, are modified versions of other scripts on these forums to show you, as an example, how it all comes togeather. They are not included in this release.

#### Dependencies

This list may grow over time as functionality expands and will be reviewed every release made.

###### Notes:
There are also other scripts created by others that I have bundled within for my own debugging and getting around like **[this](https://forum.cfx.re/t/a-noclip-but-it-doesnt-suck-like-all-others/794491)** one.
They may or may not be included in the future and thats why I haven't bothered adding them to the above.
