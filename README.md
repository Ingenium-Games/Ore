# _c : A Multi Character _Core for FiveM Resources. 
### An Overview
This is a continual work in progress, please be advised that things 
may and will change, I've been rolling around for a long time and since my first born, I've lost the bulk amount of free time, So I'm open to people helping.
If you just want to use it, it may be best to use the release section for stable/semi stable builds and not clone it.

While I originally wanted a ***Hurr Durr RP*** server and was building this for that purpose, I realized this could be expanded upon to feature many game modes.

The latest releases are available for live test on our Test Server.

You can join it, by joining our **[discord](https://discord.gg/988ERxVF2t)** and hitting the :video_game: 
emoji on the #welcome page.

You can find it from a simple search within the **[server browser](https://servers.fivem.net/)**: ***ingenium.games***

There are other resources used on it that are modified versions of other scripts out there, only to show you how this would function, they may not be used in the future of this project.

#### Requirements

The aptitude to follow instructions.

**Read** the FiveM documentation found **[here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/)**.

#### Depenancies

This list may grow over time as functionality expands and will be reviewed every release made.

###### Notes:
There are also other scripts created by others that I have bundled within for my own debugging and getting around like **[this](https://forum.cfx.re/t/a-noclip-but-it-doesnt-suck-like-all-others/794491)** one.
They may or may not be included in the future and thats why I haven't bothered adding them to the above.

#### View and Progress

My attention after initial release will be towards the following sections of the core.
