Reviewing implimentations on how traits could work.

EG - Fat / Obease trait.
    Hunger Increases 2x quicker.
    Max hp is buffed by 120
    Movement speed is 0.82
    Melee attack damage halfed
    Health slowly decreases while out of stam and running.
    Eating food items gains regenerates 5 hp instantly, 30 over a mintute. 5 per 10 sec tick.


EG - Legs of Steel
    Cycle speed increased by 20%
    can run for longer without loosing stam.
    speed increased to 1.09
    thirst decreases 1.55x rate.
    stress increases while not moving.
    stress decreases while running for longer than 5 minutes.
    drugs matabolise faster and effects are halved.


How to impliment would be another question...

Upon creation or by performaing actions that are tracked via the DB?
